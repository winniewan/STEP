        <h2>2018 Google’s CSSI Program</h2>
        <img src="images/experience/cssi/cssi1.jpg" alt="cssi"/>
        <p>
          I participated in Google’s CSSI Program in Google’s NYC office.
          Google's Computer Science Summer Institute is a three-week
          introduction to computer science for graduating high school
          seniors with a passion for technology — especially students
          from historically underrepresented groups in the field. This
          was an eye opening experience because it was my first contact
          with CS in the industry. I was able to build personal networks
          and friendships in a unique environment filled with people from
          different backgrounds. I still keep in touch with my peers in
          the program!

        <img src="images/experience/dandyhacks/dandyhacks1.png" alt="dandyhacks"/>
        <p>
          This is the University of Rochester’s annual 36-hour hackathon.
          I was part of the hackathon’s organizing team - team of 15 students.
          We had over 100 participants come from everywhere to attend the event.
          It was a thrilling experience to work with sponsors, food vendors,
          professors, the university, my team members, and most importantly,
          the hackers themselves.

        <p>
          Google’s Engineering Practicum Internship has been renamed to STEP
          and it’s exactly the same program. During the internship, I was on
          the Geo Team, specifically the Google My Business (GMB) iOS team.
          I was working on a project that creates a better experience for
          merchants to add features to their business profile.

        <p>
          This year is a little different from the others. During the time of
          the pandemic, Google is hosting their internships virtually. I am
          currently working at my home in NYC. The internship project has
          changed to open source and I am on the Google Cloud team,
          specifically the Proctor team. The project will be a (flexible)
          capstone project and I am excited to be working with 2 other STEP
          interns, my hosts, and my team members.

        <p>
          This year’s GHC will be hosting their event virtually. The Grace
          Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is a series of conferences
          designed to bring the research and career interests of women in
          computing to the forefront. It is the world's largest gathering of
          women in computing. There will be more information upcoming about
          this event since it will be hosted virtually.
