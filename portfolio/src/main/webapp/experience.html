      <h1>2018 Google’s CSSI Program</h1>

      <p>
        I participated in Google’s CSSI Program in Google’s NYC office.
        Google's Computer Science Summer Institute is a three-week
        introduction to computer science for graduating high school
        seniors with a passion for technology — especially students
        from historically underrepresented groups in the field. This
        was an eye opening experience because it was my first contact
        with CS in the industry. I was able to build personal networks
        and friendships in a unique environment filled with people from
        different backgrounds. I still keep in touch with my peers in
        the program!

      <h1>2019 U of R’s Dandyhacks</h1>

      <p>
        This is the University of Rochester’s annual 36-hour hackathon.
        I was part of the hackathon’s organizing team - team of 15 students.
        We had over 100 participants come from everywhere to attend the event.
        It was a thrilling experience to work with sponsors, food vendors,
        professors, the university, my team members, and most importantly,
        the hackers themselves.

      <h1>2019 Google’s EP Internship</h1>
      <img src="images/experience/ep/ep5.jpg" alt="ep"/>
      <p>
        Google’s Engineering Practicum Internship has been renamed to STEP
        and it’s exactly the same program. During the internship, I was on
        the Geo Team, specifically the Google My Business (GMB) iOS team.
        I was working on a project that creates a better experience for
        merchants to add features to their business profile.

      <h1>2020 Google’s STEP Internship</h1>
      <img src="images/experience/step/step.jpg" alt="step"/>
      <p>
        This year is a little different from the others. During the time of
        the pandemic, Google is hosting their internships virtually. I am
        currently working at my home in NYC. The internship project has
        changed to open source and I am on the Google Cloud team,
        specifically the Proctor team. The project will be a (flexible)
        capstone project and I am excited to be working with 2 other STEP
        interns, my hosts, and my team members.

      <img src="images/experience/ghc/ghc.jpg" alt="ghc"/>
      <p>
        This year’s GHC will be hosting their event virtually. The Grace
        Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is a series of conferences
        designed to bring the research and career interests of women in
        computing to the forefront. It is the world's largest gathering of
        women in computing. There will be more information upcoming about
        this event since it will be hosted virtually.
