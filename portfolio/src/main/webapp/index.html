          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I’m Winnie, a rising junior at the University of Rochester
            studying Computer Science and Psychology. As a software developer,
            I am constantly learning new skills and working on side projects.
            Besides the technical side of my life, there are many hobbies that
            I love like playing games and baking. Especially during this time,
            I am picking up new hobbies like planting and dancing! Most
            importantly, I am a guinea pig mom! Learn more about me by
            exploring this website that I’ve created as Project 1 of my 2020
            Google’s STEP Internship :)

          <h2>New York City</h2>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in New York City, the city that never sleeps.
            Although many believe that NYC is an expensive city to live in, I
            grew up in a lower income neighborhood. This type of population
            may not be represented in TV shows or movies, but it’s what I love
            about the city - the people ... and the food!

          <h2>Rochester, NY</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve chosen the University of Rochester for college because it’s
            7 hours away from home. Since university is a 4 year experience,
            I would want to spend those years with a traditional experience,
            where there is a big campus and a dormitory life. Also, they’ve
            given me a large financial aid package haha :) But student loans
            are still tough.

          <h2>Google STEP Internship</h2>
          <p>
            This is where I am right now! I am currently interning at Google
            as a STEP intern. STEP is the Student Training in Engineering Program.
            This is a 12 week program that offers students the opportunity to work
            on a software project alongside 2 other STEP interns, with the support
            of full-time Googlers and a mentor. Due to the 2020 pandemic, there
            have been some changes, but overall it has the same goal - prepare us
            to become future software engineers!
