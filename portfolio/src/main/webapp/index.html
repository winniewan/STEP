        Hi, I’m Winnie, a rising junior at the University of Rochester
        studying Computer Science and Psychology. As a software developer,
        I am constantly learning new skills and working on side projects.
        Besides the technical side of my life, there are many hobbies that
        I love like playing games and baking. Especially during this time,
        I am picking up new hobbies like planting and dancing! Most
        importantly, I am a guinea pig mom! Learn more about me by
        exploring this website that I’ve created as Project 1 of my 2020
        Google’s STEP Internship :)

      <h1>New York City</h1>

      <p>
        I was born and raised in New York City, the city that never sleeps.
        Although many believe that NYC is an expensive city to live in, I
        grew up in a lower income neighborhood. This type of population
        may not be represented in TV shows or movies, but it’s what I love
        about the city - the people ... and the food!
      </p>

      <h1>Rochester, NY</h1>
      <img src="images/home/uofr.jpg" alt="uofr"/>
      <p>
        I’ve chosen the University of Rochester for college because it’s
        7 hours away from home. Since university is a 4 year experience,
        I would want to spend those years with a traditional experience,
        where there is a big campus and a dormitory life. Also, they’ve
        given me a large financial aid package haha :) But student loans
        are still tough.

      <h1>Google STEP Internship</h1>

      <p>
        This is where I am right now! I am currently interning at Google
        as a STEP intern. STEP is the Student Training in Engineering Program.
        This is a 12 week program that offers students the opportunity to work
        on a software project alongside 2 other STEP interns, with the support
        of full-time Googlers and a mentor. Due to the 2020 pandemic, there
        have been some changes, but overall it has the same goal - prepare us
        to become future software engineers!
