        <h1>Baking</h1>
          <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
          <img src="images/hobbies/baking/cookies.jpg" alt="cookies"/>
          <p>
            Chocolate cookies are the best to make for a sweet tooth!
            It's easy to make and it also tastes good!
          </p>

          <h2>Watermelon Cookies</h2>
          <img src="images/hobbies/baking/watermelon.jpeg" alt="watermelon"/>
          <p>
            Alongside with chocolate chip cookies, I've made sugar
            cookies, but shaped like watermelons by adding a few
            food coloring. It looks very cute!
          </p>

          <h2>Chinese Dessert</h2>
          <img src="images/hobbies/baking/dessert.jpg" alt="dessert"/>
          <p>
            As an Asian American, I am learning some of my chinese culture's
            dessert. This one is called "but jai go", translated to little
            sugar cup desserts. The ingredients are just flour, sugar, and water!
            (I've used brown sugar to get that color, but you can use white sugar).
            A very simple and delicious dessert!

      <div id="cooking">
        <h1>Cooking</h1>
          <h2>Chicken with Vegetables</h2>
          <img src="images/hobbies/cooking/chicken.jpg" alt="chicken"/>
          <p>
            Besides baking, I tried my best to learn to cook especially
            since I'm a college student. This is a chicken drumstick with
            broccoli and cauliflower. I just can't decide which Vegetables
            to add, so I added both!
          </p>

          <h2>Dalgona Coffee</h2>
          <img src="images/hobbies/cooking/dalgona.jpg" alt="dalgona"/>
          <p>
            Ever since quarantine started, Dalgona Coffee has hit
            popularity. I had to try it. I would consider this as
            half cooking! It does take some work, but the results are
            amazing!
          </p>

          <h2>Chicken Katsu</h2>
          <img src="images/hobbies/cooking/katsu.jpeg" alt="katsu"/>
          <p>
            This is a very popular Japanese dish called Chicken
            Katsu, or also known as Chicken Cutlet. It's made by
            flattening the chicken and dipping it in flour, egg,
            and panko crumbs. Then fry until golden brown. Very delicious!

          <h2>Iris</h2>
          <img src="images/hobbies/planting/iris.jpg" alt="iris"/>
          <p>
            I've started getting plants for my room and for my outside
            small front yard. Plants help bring life into the home and
            this first plant is a type of succulent. I named it Iris :)
          </p>

          <h2>Oliver</h2>
          <img src="images/hobbies/planting/oliver.jpg" alt="oliver"/>
          <p>
            Alongside with Iris, this is Oliver. Oliver is a type of
            exotic angel plant!

          <h2>First time snowboarding!</h2>
          <img src="images/hobbies/snowboarding/snowboarding.jpg" alt="snowboarding"/>
          <p>
            Since I attend university upstate, a popular sport is snowboarding.
            Rochester can get extremely cold and what's better to do than snowboard!
            This is a picture of me during my first time snowboarding. The very
            next day was a nightmare - full of bruises, but it was fun!
